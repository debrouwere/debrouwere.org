MY MARKDOWN/TEXTILE/JADE HYBRID

* Javascript (perhaps w/ Jison?) so it can work both client-side and server-side.
* support for html5 tags like kbd, highlight, ins, del
* support for images with captions (figcaption)
* autolink URLs
* lists like Markdown, and likewise for headers, blockquotes, code blocks, inline code (backticks)
* GitHub-style links
* ``passthrough``
* Jade block tag descriptors
* Optional pass through typogrify (widont, smartypants, ...)
* Paragraph anchors (with prefix of choice, handy if you want anchors on e.g. each paragraph for each comment on a page)

.whatever			=>	<div class="whatever">
p.whatever.dude(attr='blah')	=>	<p class="whatever dude" attr="blah">
#, ##, ...			=>	h1, h2, h3, ...		(setext or atx, like Markdown)
[link]				=>	<a href="link">link</a>
[descr|link]			=>	<a href="link>descr</a>
`code`				=>	<code>
^super^
> blockquote (w/ multiline support)
![img]
![caption-which-will-equal-alt|img]
![|alt|img]
![caption||img]
![caption|alt|img]
|highlight this part| of the phrase
~delete this~
+add this+

* bold & italic etc. within link descriptions and captions
* q (html5 quote) and attribution for both q and bq	"This is an inline quote"@[Paul Bradshaw]
* markdown-style OL, but should also work with
	X. one
	X. two
	X. three
* maybe other microformat / semantic web goodness to give this markup language its own distinct flavor?

No support:
	- kbd
	- sub

Candidates for inclusion: 
	- abbr
	- samp

The interesting thing about Textile and Markdown is that they allow plain html, so we could just have, for example, <kbd>keyboard instruction</kbd>. So we shouldn't want/try to create an alternative syntax to HTML.
