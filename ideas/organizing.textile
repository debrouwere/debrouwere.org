There are tons of ways to organize something, and tons of ways to communicate with people. (PRO/CON)

There are meetup groups.

There are hackfests.

There are barcamps.

There are drinks.

There are blogging carnivals.

There are blogging advents.

There are twitter chats.

There's IRC.

There are newsletters.

There are websites.

There are forums and question-answer platforms.

There are podcasts.
