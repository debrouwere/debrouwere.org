Start with story about Ed Reed, and his rumination that maybe it's not computers and machines that are getting ever closer to being like us, it's us that are getting ever closer to acting like machines. -- This leads us to be optimistic about what metadata and machine learning can do to improve and automate our journalism; but the crux is that we've  actually dragged down the quality of our content to a degree that we can do so. I don't agree with two-years-ago me anymore when two-years-ago me was excited about the opportunities to make superb automated topic pages, complete with a difference between top stories and tangential ones, timelines, maps and everything. It's not that you can't, but it's that, for those topics for which it really matters, maybe we should've rather used the time we spent meticulously annotating each and every story with metadata, used that time to hand-craft a couple of amazing topic pages and accompanying specials in print. Pick your battles and create less content that's really great. It's not because, as Shirky says, the problem isn't information overload but filter failure, that we're all supposed to produce more content and not care about the quality anymore.

* libraries have (and need!) a one-size-fits-all catalogue: the very same bits of metadata for each and every book, magazine, whatever
* online, you don't really need this
- leads to halfway-there products that look robotic, no content strategy
- topics/categories are too fluid anyway to matter
- if you just invest in search (and it's disappointing how few news orgs do) then findability can increase to about the same level that you get with tags, sometimes even better (due to synonym awareness etc.), but without any effort in annotating.
- It's true, only manual metadata annotation can truly surface *every* story about a topic, person or organization predictably. But the happy fact is that only researchers need this kind of exhaustivity, whereas for most readers a good selection, preferably with explanatory notes or as part of a narrative, is what leads to truly engaging "topic pages".
- Instead, we should take Matt Waite's approach and create apps for every kind of news we publish, so that we have the precise structure we need. E.g. for fact-checking you'd want to reference a politician, the party he or she belongs to, the statement made, supporting facts and so on. For recipes it's the cuisine, time to cook, how expensive it is, et cetera. For news about local politics, it might be about issues (problems and how our politicians and local groups are solving them) and locations (is this in my neighborhood?). For culture, links to venues are important (and what can drive an events calendar, not just the reporting). And so on. _That's_ the valuable stuff. Generic metadata is what you do (a) for all the really basic stuff (this is the title, this is the author, this is the publication date) and (b) when you have absolutely no alternative, yet are absolutely convinced you need some form of metadata anyway.
