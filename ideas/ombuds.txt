Dan komen we aan bij mijn ruminaties over "journalism as ombudsmanship." (En ombuds zijn afwisselend contractuele posities of interne posities in bedrijven. Voor journalist/ombudsen kunnen ditto beide modellen werken.)

* This is a recurring theme for local news: there are actually big chunks of this that the local government could and maybe should play a more active role in, e.g. providing a place for citizens to point out problems, suggest ideas and voice complaints. Unless accusations of corruption are involved or more fundamental criticism about how the city is being run, in which case it's important to have a third party like a news organization involved (though a city ombuds is another option!), there's really no reason why a government can't run a "city improvement program" - or could be an important sponsor of an independent non-profit. Turning this into applications (whether EveryBlock-like or SeeClickFix-like) may have unintended effects --- giving people yet another opportunity to tune out, because it's no longer part of their daily news fix --- but it really is food for thought to what extent the government should fill this function, or journalism, or whether it doesn't really matter as long as it gets done, or whether there are other reasons for us to prefer that a newspaper is in charge of this stuff? Maybe we shouldn't use public money to do what private companies can manage. On the other hand, you could argue that having this set up as a sort of ombudsman service can ensure that ombudspeople can keep badgering the government about issues that cause a lot of frustration, whereas if you approach it as journalism, once you've done your story you've done your story, and important issues fading from the public's eye is a serious problem for journalism. And surely there's in-betweens, like an Open311 system where the government provides the basic platform and perhaps some end-user services (I'm not the first to see the link between journalism and open government efforts, opengov defined more broadly than transparency / availability of datasets), but explicitly engineers for innovation by citizens and private companies. And then there's the issue of access: as more news websites are experimenting with paywalls, and considering newspapers have always been (mostly) paid: is it really proper to deny people access to this important civic instrument if they can't or won't pay for it? Shouldn't we instead urge people to make use of it?

* Another problem is that many governments *are* actually taking steps in this direction, making it a territory that entrepreneurs are loathe to step in, because at any moment they might have to start competing with the government who has important advantages (easy access to city data, for a start)

* When you think of journalism as ombudsmanship, the link between journalism and getting people's attention disappears, because, in essence, people (and organizations and the government) are paying you so spend time doing what they need but don't want to do. People have similar attitudes to charities: some people care to stay up-to-date, but others just want to give money and are happy leaving it at that
