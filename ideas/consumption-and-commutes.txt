I'd be curious to see to what degree a newspaper's weekday success is impacted by (1) how many employed adults commute to work rather than working near home and (2) how many of those commuters use public transportation (where you can read something) versus car, bike or walking. One of the reasons why the US East Coast is such a nice area for newspapers to be in, it seems to me, is a lot of affluent consumers that commute by public transport. And it's the same reason, I'm guessing, why here in Flanders, with our barely 6 million inhabitants, we have seven big newspapers, assorted locals and a free metro: in addition to having lots of wealthy people (which advertisers like) in a very compact area (which cuts down on delivery costs, which are government-subsidized anyway), roughly 250.000 students and working professionals take the train every day and need something to read on that train.
