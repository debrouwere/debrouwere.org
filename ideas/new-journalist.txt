* Content is getting commoditized, but personalities aren't. Conversation isn't.
* Content is our ticket for admission, not what will make us succeed
* build products around passion groups
* Beat reporters should really own their beat, and not just cover e.g. town hall meetings, but "own" their turf. As Becky would say: I'd love reporters to come to me and tell me: "Hey, I'm going to cover this and this and this, and then I'll be talking to x, and then I'll be studying that dossier, and that may lead to a piece on y..." whereas most of the time subeditors still have to work as glorified list keepers and give out assignments. Me: I'd love it if more journalists started reading Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk, and start taking things into their own hands.

There's this ethos in some parts of the journalism world, at the management layer, but also the stuff that you hear from academics, that journalists just can't adapt to this new world. They've learned to do things a certain way and can't see why they'd ever want to do anything else. And as much as I'd like to disagree (I'm an intensely optimistic person, probably a trait I got from reading so much of John Dewey's work), journalists just aren't seeing all the opportunities that are out there do connect with their audiences and do better journalism (Tim: but more of them are slowly realizing that better interaction with audiences means more leads and more contacts, and that means more and better stories.)

* Woodward and Bernstein-style journalists: that's not about user interaction, it's about scoops. Any interaction with readers would only make the process less objective. And if that's what J-schools are holding up as the people you should imitate, obviously that's going to lead to journalists who conceive of themselves as lone rangers, stepping where nobody's gone before and eking out the truth, for the people to then read, assimilate and be impressed. But that's not how it was before W&B, and that's not how it should be now. We need new role models.

* reporters should think of themselves as _reporters_, not broadcast or print or online reporters, but that'll take a while
* reporters are scared of user interaction, user contributions and anything of the sort because they think that it will put them out of jobs (cf. ook Europees onderzoek hiernaar). Whereas they should be thinking about how those contributions enhance the conversation, and how they can redefine their role to get to an end state that is better than what we had before. Where people are more informed, are getting more news than they used to, etc.
* Niche-sites: reporters should jump at the chance to be able to interact in a direct way with a more passionate audience, even if that means they have to build a brand instead of being able to rely on the old "big newspaper" brand. I've seen this myself since my time at the student newspaper: people are scared about writing for online, because it isn't as refined, haughty or whatever.

They are getting the opportunities they've always wanted: to really explore subjects in depth and gain an intimate connection to and respect by their readers. They're maybe not getting these opportunities in the way they've dreamed they would — the average reporter has the business acumen of a marmoset, so no surprise there — but despite all the complaints about deteriorating standards and the demise of investigate journalism, _there are opportunities right in front of their nose_.

* use the best tool in the toolkit: photography, video, liveblog, different journalistic genres (news report, feature, insight & opinion, ...)
