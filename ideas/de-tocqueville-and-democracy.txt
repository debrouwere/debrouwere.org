Something different

* Blanket statements like "democracy sucks, but it's better than everything else" hide the fact that there is no such thing as democracy. I mean, there's a group of related ways of governing that all have in common with each other that people have some say over who rules and thus (mostly indirectly) over how countries are ruled, but I don't think anybody would confuse the democracy in Ancient Greece with the one we have over here in Belgium, say.
* What's so nice about De Tocqueville is that he didn't care about proclaiming democracy good or bad, he wanted to know what _American_ democracy was like around, around 1831, and not just American democracy but also different ways of doing things in different parts of the country. And what he described was a system with some parts he liked, some parts he disliked, and some parts he wasn't quite decided on.
* That seems such a sensical, such a straightforward way to do things. But it's also really hard to do, it takes a lot of time, and it doesn't really give anybody any moral support, it's not the kind of blanket statement saying "democracy is great and everything else is awful" that we would like to hear.
* Which is why De Tocqueville is known as an essayist or a sociologist, and not a philosopher. Instead, the philosophical work most known for its defense of democracy is Karl Popper's The Free Society. Which is exactly that: a pretty much a priori reasoning about why democracy, any kind really, because of its tendencies to promote piecemeal improvements over dangerous revolutions, is always the superior form of government.
* Now that may all be very soothing, but after a while you do start asking what we really learn from such a blanket statement. It doesn't really help us improve our way of government, and it doesn't give us the tools to spot when things are going awry. We've proven a great principle, but the fruit of such proof is hard to come by.
* It's the same thing in epistemology wrt. studying reasoning; the Cartesian approach.
* And the interesting thing is that philosophers are even reinterpreting old philosophers, people like John Stuart Mill who were very concerned with what was going on in their society, and searching for an answer as to how to guide it along, are being condensed in philosophy textbooks and scholarly articles, to their bare essence: a couple of hypotheses or statements, stripped of their context, and thus evaluated for their eternal truthfulness.
* And we're surprised then, that no longer is philosophy at the center of civil society like it was in the 18th and 19th centuries. That everybody's heard of Kant, but nobody about Dworkin.
