Main gist: I don't really like conferences myself, mainly because I hate stepping up to and talking with strangers (which is why I love to blog, it's like inverse networking) and so lose out on a lot of the networking opportunities, and just the plain opportunity to meet kindred spirits and have a great time... but there are also some other dynamics

* conferences as fun trips
* conferences as networking opportunities
* I've heard some great, inspiring talks, which resonate more than a blogpost with similar content would simply because of the format (you can rouse people etc.) and lightning talks are fun to learn a lot of different stuff in a short period of time, and workshops are a very friendly format for beginners... but most conference talks I've ever heard are inferior to just reading two or three good blogposts about the subject they cover. It's why so many people multitask and tweet and muck about when listening to talks: just listening to a talk and doing nothing else is usually a waste of time.
* conferences because organizing conferences and speaking at conferences are things that convey your importance in a community (regardless of their actual usefulness) so there are incentives to organize conferences, meetups and the like, and getting reasonably good speakers free or at a minimal cost is easy-peasy.
* Maybe we need to explore some alternatives more... well, we already are: the lightning talks + socializing formula, hackathons and codefests, barcamps with active sessions (where you actually *do* something instead of listening), ... I think those conference formats keep the good parts of conferences while being just a little bit more honest too.
