I've followed quite a few discussions about CoffeeScript out there, like http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2683372, and it's always surprising to hear people say that they don't need it, that JavaScript isn't really that difficult, that they can do without. Of course you can. I'm sure some people could be reasonably productive coding web apps in C. But the fact is that you think differently about your code when some of the easy stuff is actually identical conceptually to what you write down in code (as e.g. is the benefit of prefix/postfix notations and list comprehensions). You can forego these and it'll just mean adding one or two lines of extra code in some cases where you'd have used a list comprehension otherwise (same in PHP, not just JS) but dang, it's amazing to see the extent to which you can really make progress when you don't have to worry about trifles.

E.g. one of the most annoying things about JavaScript, to me, is that it doesn't have .endswith and .startswith methods, even though with a single line of code using indexOf you can do the same thing. But you'll be thinking about computer code, not about expressing the idea you had in the code.

Really, you're not any better than any one of us because you can do things the hard way. Just stupid.
