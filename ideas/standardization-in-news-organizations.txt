Advice when evaluating standards
================================

The newspaper industry has a lot of standards floating around, but unfortunately most of them are ageing and not very well adapted to the digital age. In particular, don't let recent updates to the IPTC standards and taxonomies deceive you into thinking they're up to date or industry best practices.

So, do we define our own internal standards (e.g. NPR has their own "custom XML structure specifically designed to represent all of NPR's digital content comprehensively") or do we stick with accepted standards because of the interoperability they offer with some software like SAXoTECH?

I believe internal standards often make more sense than adopting e.g. the NITF or NewsML formats, or sticking to the IPTC NewsCodes.

Interoperability is not nearly as big an issue as it might seem. If you worry about structure instead of standards, mapping that structure — whatever it may be — to standards like the XML-based NITF is a simple process. The challenge is making sure that the structure in which you store your content accurately brings out the actual structure inherent in that content, so that you're not forcing content into an ill-suited mold.

If you can make sure that your content is more than just a big blob of text, adhering to certain standards  hardly ever remains an issue.

The other way around — trying to create any applications that depend on rich metadata out of constrained standards — is a hellish challenge.

It makes sense to be aware of any and all existing standards, and to refer back to them frequently when establishing information architecture guidelines, but it's foolish to arbitrarely constrain yourself to standards that don't fit your needs or your data. To `quote myself <http://stdout.be/2010/we-are-in-the-information-business/>`_: 

  Still, the structured metadata offered by formats like NITF isn’t all sunshine and roses. Traditional approaches to structured news content are seriously hampered by their focus on standardization and exchange. NITF is incredibly useful, but exchange between different news orgs and import/export between different software platforms is really all it is useful for. [...] nowadays it’s not about standards or interoperability, it’s about bringing out the structure in your specific content in a way that serves your goals. That kind of structure will be different for each newspaper because they all have different formats and different beats.
