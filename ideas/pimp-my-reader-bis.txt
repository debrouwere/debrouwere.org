* *Collaboration.* For big, big topics like American politics, the workload of combing through a gazillion feeds is just too great for one person to bear, so I want a way to easily divide up work and see what colleagues are reading and processing.
* *Publishing.* I want to be able to share posts through Facebook and twitter, straight from my reader.
