One thing I'd like to add to that, is that journalists are kidding both themselves and their readers if they hold on to the haughty ideal of objectivity. What they should hold on to, is transparency and fairness. But fairness can sometimes mean just coming out and being very honest about the fact that you have a strong opinion about the stuff you're writing about, or maybe even that there might be a conflict of interest. People don't want you to be a robot without an opinion (which has led to some incredibly weird storytelling techniques, like "always give both sides to the story equal attention, even if that's not what they're worth). More and more, people are taking journalists up on their promise to "give the facts, and I'll form my own opinion", but turn that around to "Give me the facts, your take on them and the raw materials (recordings, sources, documents) that led to your conclusions, and I'll make up for myself whether I think you're trustworthy." Journalistic ethics aren't disappearing, they're evolving
