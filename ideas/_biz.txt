* about the good old-fashioned sponsorship — if your business owner or the presenter can't make your company or product sound interesting in two honest sentences, without the help of whiz-bang advertising, then that says a lot. The relationship between the money that comes in and the realization of the program is also much clearer — whereas for an ad you usually don't make the connection between advertiser and "the guys that make this program possible". On a more cynical side, it helps with ad blindness http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/are-advertisers-wasting-their-money-111254549.html which is at almost 50% for internet ads, since the announcement of the sponsor is either part of the lede (for text) or the intro for broadcast radio or video — that is, it's integrated in the content, not something you have to sit through in order to get to the content. http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/are-advertisers-wasting-their-money-111254549.html I actually don't mind this at all. Sponsorship messages on radio shows, especially the way they used to be done, have an aesthetic value and an authenticity to them a precision-engineered banner ad simply doesn't have. It says "Hey guys, we make this product which we think you may like, feel free to check us out and enjoy the show, like we will" instead of "BUY MORE DIET PEPSI".

* about how brand equity is becoming more important again, esp. for locals but really for every newspaper, now the ad model is waning and we have to rely on (1) engaging users through events, sponsored projects and the like and (2) part of our profit will have to come from selling the kind of expertise we showcase on our website and in our paper, 

* The Kickstarter model for local news: commercial strategy should be based on getting people to feel like we're helping them make their neighborhoods better places, more fun places. Take a cue from Kickstarter, where it's almost addictive to give money to people because it's cool and you *want to be a part of it*. Authenticity. Good-natured fun. Being part of something bigger. Getting appreciation for giving. Excitement. *Not* the obligation to pay "because this stuff costs money, period". *Not* desperate pleas to support the fourth pillar of democracy either.

* how the web has freed print from its shackles -- allowing us to create an experience that is complementary to the web

* The importance of getting your readers into certain routines. Stories about about how people miraculously find a new tool that changes their life, find that suddenly starting to run helps them focus, find out that they were magazine lovers all along but just never took the time, or find out a website that's been going for ages and lament about not finding it earlier. And stories abound too, of people who say they know and love something, want to do it more often... but somehow it doesn't happen. Excluding those cases when we're actually kidding ourselves (do we really love running but "just sometimes forget about the daily run"?) what's happening is that (1) people don't know that a certain habit or a certain tool or a certain hobby or whatever would actually be really pleasant, and (2) they do, but it just doesn't find their way into their habits somehow. People find ways to improve their lives all the time, and don't find 'em just as often. That's the challenge we're facing when we're doing podcasts, e-reader integration and so forth: everybody who tries these things loves them, the tech is free or cheap so that's not an issue either, but first you have to warm people to the idea before you can actually profit from stuff like podcasts, or dossiers on the e-reader, or Kindle Singles. Finding great content in my browser and then zapping it to my Kindle with Readability has become my modus operandi for any blogpost longer than four paragraphs. I've started reading again, after getting into the nasty habbit of just skimming through every blogpost I read. And I've also started paying for stuff: weekly magazines, kindle singles, e-books, the whole gamut — it's instant gratification, but in a good way. However, even though I've seen how lovely e-readers can be, how they change how I think about paying for content, and how they've transformed my reading experience... I still wouldn't be inclined to launch an e-reader project at a newspaper, unless you can afford to put a lot of marketing into educating your users and teasing them into new habits. Now, podcasts are a different story: many people sort of know what they are and what they do, but what's still lacking here is an answer to "well, is this for me?" And then RSS feeds are different still: big news consumers can all get a lot of benefit out of an RSS reader (and in fact, journalists could too)

How can we encourage late adopters to try new stuff without bombarding all our readers with a constant barrage of "TRY OUR NEW IPAD APP IT'S REALLY GREAT"? Not every technology has the same mindshare or critical adoption as the iPad to be obvious or intuitive to people, but they might be ideal platforms anyway. And many people are asking themselves the question of what they heck it is an iPad is supposed to do, so... If you can answer that question, you can switch to newer tech more quickly, and reap the monetization benefits.
