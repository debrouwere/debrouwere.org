Feedback from meeting: 

- last 30 days, but also per-month "archives"
- split out per section in addition to a general overview (long-term: per user)
- bump up engagement and buzz metrics
- display trends, w/ popups

------------

Information to extract: 
 
=> See what people care about

(Preferably split out by time of day -- which would have to be a custom variable -- so we can see if there are any important differences in time on site, the sorts of pages people visit etc.)

(Preferably also split out by in-state / out-of-state + search, to avoid overvaluing certain content.)

- most popular stories last day / last week
- % visits per section

=> Vanity metrics (mainly useful for advertisers, not as a performance guide)

- pageviews
- visits
- unique visitors

=> Get an overview

- time on site
- social media activity
- engaged visits (OR'ed together custom segment based on pageviews, certain duration, logged in, last visit)
- "true fan" visits (same thing as / similar to engaged visits, but AND'ed together)

=> Improve loyalty and time on site

(Preferably segmented out by loyal / irregular / out-of-state visitors.)

- pages per visit
- visits per month
- avg. visit duration
- bounce rate
- garbage visits as a percentage of total visits and a percentage of total pageviews (visit duration < 1 min) [you can't avoid this, but you need to subtract these visits from your "real visitor" numbers ]

=> Sharing

- amount of tweets and FB shares we get on stories
- referral traffic
  - as a percentage of total visits
  - split out by twitter / facebook / google reader / other (= referrals from sites)
    w/ bounce rate as secondary metric

GOALS

In general, we should figure out goals first, and then come up with the information we need later. "Get more people to the site" is likely to be too vague, but "get more people to share" or "get people to look at more pages" could make sense.

The point is, only collect analytics if you know why, and only if metrics tell you whether you're achieving your goals or not. Use metrics as part of tests (new design, promo campaign, ...) to see the effectiveness of different things, not "just for the sake of measuring."

And always prefer per-person metrics (time on site, pages per person) versus gross metrics (total pageviews).

EASING

* don't display trends smaller than 5%
* compare last 30 days to the 90 days before that

INTERESTING SEGMENTS

- morning / afternoon / evening traffic 

SEGMENTS

We can get segmented data, e.g. bounce rate for loyal visitors vs. first-time visitors, not through the raw data but with the help of "advanced segments".

Google provides a bunch of these segments out of the box: all visits / new visitors / returning visitors / paid search traffic / non-paid search traffic / search traffic / direct traffic / referral traffic / visits with conversions / visits with transactions / mobile traffic / non-bounce visits.

You can create your own segments, e.g. all people who visited in the last 3 days, local (from Cedar Rapids), who didn't bounce after viewing a single page. With a careful selection of dimensions/metrics, you could segment your loyal visitors from non-loyal local visitors from drive-by visitors (people from outside of Iowa, people who come from search), and you could start to focus on specific goals, e.g. reduce bounce when they enter The Gazette through search or social media (but not known-item search)

You can set up these custom segments programmatically, but it's really easiest to just set them up in the Google Analytics UI and then grab them from there. You can then display these things in a custom report (programmatic access to the API), a Geckoboard or in a custom report in Google Analytics itself.

CUSTOM VARIABLES

You can set custom variables for visitors, sessions and individual pages.

You can track 5 custom variables on each level (50 w/ premium --- but that's reportedly $150,000 a year)

page => e.g. section, is_longform, is_linkbait, read_to_bottom, arrived_from_related_stories_widget
session => arrived from social media, made a purchase, used the section pages and not just front page, morning/noon/afternoon/evening visit, logged-in 
visitor => age, gender, ...

CLUSTERS AND COHORTS

You can get segments, but what's tougher is finding clusters / binning types of consumers / putting customers in cohorts depending on when they started using your product.

For example, you can figure out with Google Analytics whether people read more/less sports during their AM visits, figure out what percentage of your visitors are sports-related (X of pages in visit devoted to sports), whether sports visits are more/less engaged than "newsy" visits and so on, but you have to figure out the questions to ask yourself, it's not possible to mine for patterns (of any kind) and then figure out what those patterns mean.

A question like "do sports readers and culture readers overlap a lot?"

Additionally, you have to make sure you're not inventing groups of people that don't exist: maybe sports fans are just like any other news consumer except they read more sports. You'd have to ascertain that there are important differences in the way these people use the site (which analytics can help with!) before you try to plan on how to better serve that audience.

Tough: 

* clusters and cohorts
* demographics (GA allows you to specify custom variables, but you need to collect them yourself)
* lifetime stats (first-time visitors, long-time returning visitors, time before a users makes his/her first purchase): GA can do these, but you'll have to set up custom variables yourself
* figuring out things that unite our most loyal (or least loyal) visitors, to find things to fix or things to capitalize on -- for example, see that people who were regulars at some point but have tapered off are those that don't subscribe to our newsletter or those that read lots of gov't news -- you can do a little bit, e.g. show most loyal readers by geography, and then divide that by total population in that area (= penetration)
* only Google Analytics Premium has unsampled reports
