(and why administrators are a good thing in stable industries, even stable industries in need of innovation)

news organizations are staffed by administrators: people who are really good at keeping things going, but not that good at figuring out new, cheaper and better ways to do things. (People are usually better at one or the other, so in a stable industry, it actually makes sense to pick administrators over entrepreneurs.) So we're not innovating at the pace that we should be. There's maybe five news websites on the entire face of the earth that don't make me puke, and it's not just the design but the fact that they do nothing to encourage exploration, provide no context, have awful search engines and are infested with low-quality ads.
