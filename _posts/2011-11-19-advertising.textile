Ultimately, I think the use of advertising as a proxy mechanism for charging customers is an inefficient historical fall-out of the constraints of magazines, television, and the web. Any use of advertisement to fund modern digital distribution is indicative of one of two things: (1) A failure find a less round-about, more efficient, and more profitable mechanism for _directly_ charging consumers for what they consume OR (2) A lack of respect for the customer and an attempt to maximize profit at the expense of their enjoyment of your product.
