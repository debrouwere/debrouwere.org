Big Boy Syndrome

* real-time, big-data analytics... well, have you set up some basic goals and reports in Google Analytics yet?
* A zillion computers with load-balancers and everything... well, have you tried just basic caching first?
* Shlepping out six-figure numbers for consulting contracts... because you want to be seen as the kind of guy who can responsibly handle that kind of money
* People aren't spending enough time on our site. We need a gamification strategy. 

I've worked at a couple of different companies now, and I've consulted for a couple others, and I'm starting to notice a pattern of sorts. 

A weird phenomenon 


You could say that people have trouble seeing simple solutions, and that simple solutions are not easy to find. I'd agree, but my point is more subtle than that.

You could instead say that companies house their fair share of dullards, and that the problem is stupidity. Well, yes, but there's more to it.

What I'm talking about is a weird psychological mechanism whereby someone is unwilling to entertain simple, battle-tested, common-sensical solutions, out of a subconscious fear that they'd be seen as the kind of person who always comes up with dull solutions and bland strategies. Instead, you want to be the guy who knows the latest trends, is maybe even ahead of those trends, and also the guy who knows how to deal with very complex problems â€“ so people tend to turn simple problems into complex ones, just to be able to showcase how adroitly they can solve it.

People at smaller companies want to work like people at big companies, even if those strategies are not appropriate at all. My armchair psychologist opinion is that we all want to show we're not a kid anymore. Anticipatory socialization of sorts.

Time and time again this strategy leads companies to lose money, and managers to _not_ solve the problem at all. Which is quickly forgotten, because there's always a next problem on the horizon, and a next complex, expensive, Big Boy solution waiting to be tried out.
