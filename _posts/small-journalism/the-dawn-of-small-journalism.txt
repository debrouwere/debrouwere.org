* the dawn of small journalism

==> maybe in the future, journalism will (mostly) support small outlets. A single guy maintaining a forum, two people running a hyperlocal blog, a band of people that run a groupblog about their industry part-time, after work. Or a husband and wive reporting on every single death in Washington DC because they felt it was important. The increasing unprofitability of newspapers and big news organizations in general is a sign of decay if you're a reporter and need a job, but from society's point of view, it might just be a necessary readjustment. Just like how tech startups in the dotcom era needed a small army of systems administrators, needed to build their own servers and all that... whereas now you can get together with a friend and learn a popular framework one weekend, build an app the next, upload it somewhere and be done with it.

People have been told for so long that, as technology marches onwards, jobs aren't lost, they're created. But the way that works on a micro-level is like this: people lose lots of jobs, in due course new jobs are created and maybe, just maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find something new.

One of my great-uncles was a tailor who, after WWII when the apparel industry moved from Europe and the States to sweatshops in third-world countries with lower labor costs, became a grocery boy and then a sweeper. It sucks, it absolutely wholeheartedly sucks, but sometimes that's what progress looks like. It looks like industries shrinking and people losing jobs.

(All that content belongs in one post, though preferably a compact one. Only has to introduce the ideas [of the makers ratio, of small journalism, of not identifying an industry's worth by how many people it employs, of the part-time journalist], not blabber on about them.)
