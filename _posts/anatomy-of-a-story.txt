The anatomy of a story
----------------------

One point where the terminology of the content repository project needs some more work, is in describing the anatomy of a story. A bunch of different concepts are being packed into one term, "collections", without any clear definition of what a collection entails.

Here's a first stab at a better way of talking about stories and their constituent parts:

* **a story**: a story is the abstract container that refers to something that's being reported. We can't really call it an article, because a story can be text, video, audio or a collection of many different things, like Storify's curated stories that contain tweets, YouTube videos, photos and text. In common parlance, a story can also refer to a bunch of related content about the same event, but within a CMS, I think we're better off calling that "ongoing coverage".
* **a package**: a package is a bundle of content tailored to a specific platform: an online package, a broadcast package, and so on. Each story can be packaged in a multitude of different ways. Packages consist of different assets, and one of those assets will usually take the lead: an article with a photo is something entirely different than a photo with a couple of background paragraphs about where and how the photo was taken. Sometimes, different packages within the same story can be assigned to different reporters, editors or photographers. Sometimes that's a good thing because it speeds things up. Sometimes that's a bad thing, as when a web editor has to put everything online because the "print people" won't touch it.
* **an asset**: an asset is an individual piece of content. A photo, text, a map, a tweet, a video and so on. Although assets usually get created as part of a specific story, it's best if they can be free-floating too, so you can reuse photos from old stories or pull in some old content to serve as background for a new piece you're doing.
* **a revision**: each asset may be revised through an editorial process, we call each successive version a revision of that asset.
* **an update**: a revision to an asset after the initial publication. An update may convey new information that has come to light, or it might be a correction.
* **a take**: a take is a slightly repurposed asset, made for a specific package. E.g. a few extra lines of copy added to a text meant for print, in order to cross-reference a story on another page, which is something you don't need for the internet because you can just place a hyperlink; or a different crop of the same photo for broadcast and for online. The formal definition of a take would be an asset in one package that has a history in another package, but is now its own indepedent thing that can be edited and changed without affecting the original asset. Kind of like a fork in Git.
