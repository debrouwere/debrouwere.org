If everything that's even slightly important (like a paper's redesign, a company reorg, product strategy, whatever) gets outsourced to a consultancy because a company doesn't trust its own employees, then consultancies, freelance shops and design shops are where people will want to work, and the quality of your in-house staff goes down.

(OTOH: why working as a consultant sucks)
