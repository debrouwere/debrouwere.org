The second alternative, and it's an entirely different approach, is *selling the expertise* to thrive in the attention economy, rather than the eyeballs. Local businesses want to buy ads and sponsor events, true, but their main problem is that they usually have no idea how to promote their business. _Do I need a website? What kind of website? How do I use Facebook? What is this search engine optimization thing? Targeted advertising, what's that?_ All of those questions happen to be things forward-thinking media companies are pretty good at nowadays; we don't need to convince anyone that we can draw in a big audience to our website and that we know how this twitter thing works.

We can sell our marketing, social media and publishing expertise, both in the form of workshops, or in the form of "support contracts like those the Houston Chronicle is experimenting with":http://www.cjr.org/the_business_of_digital_journalism/chapter_eight_new_users_new_revenue.php, by selling tools we've developed ourselves to make our marketing efforts easier and with print and distribution services for newsletters, flyers and posters.
