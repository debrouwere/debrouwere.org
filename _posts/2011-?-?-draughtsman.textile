I've just put up a small app on GitHub which I've been using to help me in prototyping client-side HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'd been noticing this weird gap in how I prototyped and how I worked on production apps: the former I did quick-and-dirty in plain HTML and CSS just to get something on the page quickly, but whenever I had a prototype that looked like, hey, it might be worth actually turning into something real, I had to convert my HTML into the Jade templating language, my CSS into SASS and my JavaScript into CoffeeScript, losing valuable time but more importantly being stuck with a rather boring and uninspiring task of converting things that already work from one format to another, simply to ensure you'll stay productive in the long run.

Sure, you can use best-of-breed tools like SASS and CS even while you're hashing out a quick prototype â€” they both have command-line apps that allow you to watch a directory and precompile stylesheets and code for use in a browser. CoffeeScript even allows you to run a client-side compiler. All very nice. But even those two or three steps to getting started are just too damn annoying if you just want to hash out a quick idea.

So I wanted something PHP-like. You browse through the directory listing from your webserver, click on a .jade file and it renders HTML, transparently converting any .sass and .coffee files as well, if you have any.
