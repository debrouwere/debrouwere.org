But that's the crux, isn't it? For publishers, online advertising is the thing everyone hates but that we tolerate because it pays the bills. But with these low rates we're seeing, it doesn't pay for very much anymore (if it ever did) and so there will come a point when the revenue/annoyance ratio as well as total revenues will be so low that people will start to wonder, do I really want to pollute my website with this nonsense if it brings in less than six figures a year?

At the local media company I work for, for example, our (online) job listings and daily deals bring in more money than online advertising does. Daily deals may turn out to be a fad, and things are not yet so skewed that we can just dump online advertising, but who's to say that moment won't arrive five or ten years from now?

'Fcuz, you're right, it's a different game for Facebook and Google who can really play on scale.

Maybe more importantly though, when I see people talking about the death of advertising, what I really hear is not a scientific argument but rather a plea: "advertising sucks, let's invent something new." I really hope we do.
