Want to know what works in news?

- Instantaneous ("Al Jazeera's liveblogs":http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/) or old news (any newspaper) or even older news ("The Economist":http://www.economist.com/)
- Print-first ("most student newspapers":http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/making-sense-of-news/105600/students-prefer-printed-college-newspapers-over-online/) or digital-first ("it has saved the Journal Register papers":https://twitter.com/#!/jxpaton/status/51659385189040129) or even newsletter-first ("DailyCandy":http://www.dailycandy.com/all-cities/ and tons of B2B)
- Quality as a priority ("The New York Times":http://www.nytimes.com/) or good-enough ("Gawker":http://gawker.com/, free Metro papers around the world)
- News from all over the place ("HuffPo":http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) or proprietary ("McSweeneys":http://www.mcsweeneys.net/, "The New Republic":http://www.tnr.com/)
- Social (hacker news, reddit) or algorithmic (Google News) or editorial (Sullivan)
- Professional (every newspaper) or amateur ("Evanston Now":http://evanstonnow.com/, "Berkeleyside":http://www.berkeleyside.com/) or student ("The Local East Village":http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/)
- mobile-first (arguably "The Wall Street Journal":http://www.wsj.com/) or no mobile at all (most local and rural papers)
- niche ("TechCrunch":http://techcrunch.com/) or subculture-based ("Monocle":http://www.monocle.com/) or something for everyone (the Sunday paper).
- paywall ("The Financial Times":http://www.ft.com, "Mediapart":http://www.mediapart.fr) or porous and metered ("Morris":http://emediavitals.com/content/paywall-success-stories-three-newspapers-using-metered-model among others) or contributor memberships ("MetaFilter":http://www.metafilter.com/) no paywall (many, many others)
- service-driven ("Curbed":http://curbed.com/) or community-driven ("Davis Wiki":http://daviswiki.org/) or format-driven ("Politifact":http://www.politifact.com/) or story-driven ("Harper's":http://harpers.org/)
- collaboration ("California Watch":http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/california-watch-launches-new-media-network-8330 plus its many partners) and competition (any country with more than one national broadsheet)
- non-profit ("MinnPost":http://www.minnpost.com/) or for-profit ("The Batavian":http://thebatavian.com/)
- short ("Newser":http://www.newser.com/) or long ("Slate":http://www.slate.com/) or longer ("ProPublica's Kindle Singles":http://www.propublica.org/kindlesingles)
- being a technology company ("The Texas Tribune":http://www.texastribune.org/), meticulous about metadata ("The Guardian":http://www.guardian.co.uk/) or neither (any and all bloggers)
- opinionated ("Techdirt":http://www.techdirt.com/) or even biased ("FoxNews":http://www.foxnews.com/ or "IndyMedia":http://www.indymedia.org) or drily factual ("BBC News":http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/)

Give me a facet and I'll give you success stories from all over the spectrum. Business successes _and_ editorial ones.

People are always inclined to look for the one best solution. Fact is, you can make just about anything work if you're smart about it.
