Banner blindness is at "close to 50% for internet ads":http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/are-advertisers-wasting-their-money-111254549.html. I wonder how long it's going to take most newspapers to realize that we need to reinvent how businesses connect with our users, because banner ads are just not working out. At all.

I simply do not believe that there isn't a way to tell people about new products and services and special deals without pissing them off. After all, at the right times and in the right quantities, we want to know about the new furniture store that opened up just outside downtown, next month's concerts at the arena and about the new flavor of Doritos. 

But while we're okay with commercial information, we don't want to be bombarded with it and we don't want to learn about your Friday special through a screaming graphic that is an affront to our eyes.

Two promising avenues come to mind.

The first alternative is *selling the expertise* to thrive in the attention economy, rather than the eyeballs. Local businesses want to buy ads and sponsor events, but their main problem is that they usually have no idea how to promote their business online. _Do I need a website? What kind of website? How do I use Facebook? What is this search engine optimization thing? Targeted advertising, what's that?_ All of those questions happen to be things forward-thinking media companies are pretty good at nowadays; we don't need to convince anyone that we can draw in a big audience to our website and that we know how this twitter thing works.

We can sell our marketing, social media and publishing expertise, both in the form of workshops, or in the form of "support contracts like those the Houston Chronicle is experimenting with":":http://www.cjr.org/the_business_of_digital_journalism/chapter_eight_new_users_new_revenue.php, by selling tools we've developed ourselves to make our marketing efforts easier and with print and distribution services for newsletters, flyers and posters.

The second alternative I like is *the good old-fashioned sponsorship*. People are ignoring visually intensive advertisements, so instead of making ads stand out, we need to incorporate them in the content, but in a way that doesn't violate our journalistic integrity. Which is a pretty good description of how sponsorships worked in the early days of radio: the host thanks the sponsor, either the host or the sponsor describes what they're selling in one or two sentences, and that's that.

Sponsorships — as an ad format — have three advantages over banners.

* Since the announcement of the sponsor is either part of the lede (for text) or the intro for broadcast radio or video — that is, it's integrated in the content, not something you have to sit through in order to get to the content. That means consumers can't easily skip it, but the length of these messages also just not make it worth it.
* Sponsorship messages can also put the onus on businesses to think really hard about how to make themselves interesting to your audience; if the business owner or the presenter can't make your company or product sound interesting in two honest sentences, without the help of whiz-bang advertising, then that says a lot. Conversely, a non-existent creative budget won't lead to the ghoulishly ugly ads that local news websites now have to cope with.
* The relationship between the money that comes in and the realization of the program is also much clearer — whereas for an ad you usually don't make the connection between advertiser and "the guys that make this program possible".

I've also been really enamored by the ironic take on product placement on Stephen Colbert's show in the past few years: his purported love for Doritos and Ben and Jerry's is so over-the-top that the product placement is immediately obvious, turning the implicit message into something more like "hey, Doritos is my sponsor, they deserve some advertising, and let's be honest, these crisps aren't so bad are they?" Colbert's tone is respectful to both the advertiser and the audience; he's not trying to kid you into thinking that these are the best potato chips on earth, he's just asking you to consider buying a packet, as a courtesy to the sponsor that's making this show possible. Exactly the kind of balanced tone I think we need and that we'll be seeing more often.

Sponsorship messages on radio shows, especially the way they used to be done, have an aesthetic value and an authenticity to them a precision-engineered banner ad simply doesn't have. It says "Hey guys, we make this product which we think you may like, feel free to check us out and enjoy the show, like we will" instead of "BUY MORE DIET PEPSI".
