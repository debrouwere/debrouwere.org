This is the code to my personal blog and homepage.

The heart of my blogging platform lives in a [GNU Make][make] `Makefile`, which specifies the entire build process. Each blog post starts with YAML frontmatter (which contains metadata like the post's title) followed by the body content in [Textile][textile] markup.

1. blog posts are preprocessed with [yaml2json][yaml2json]
2. they are then bundled with [gather][gather] and [groupby][groupby]
3. some defaults are filled in with [jq][jq] and [refract][refract]
4. the [jade][jade] templates for posts and pages are rendered with [render][render]
5. [CoffeeScript][coffeescript] and [Stylus][stylus] stylesheets are compiled
6. files are moved around with [put][put] and then synced to [Amazon S3][s3] with the [AWS Command Line Interface][aws-cli]

Everything is generated by running `make`. I use [serve][serve] to check if everything looks alright on localhost, and then upload to S3 with `make upload`.

A full rebuild of the entire site takes roughly 30 seconds on my 2011 MacBook Pro, but [render][render] is smart enough to only rerender when needed, so adding a single post takes just 3 to 4 seconds.

I mostly edit my blog posts in [Mou][mou] and the templates in [Sublime Text][sublime], but everything else happens on the command line.

Previous iterations used [Hector][hector], [Jekyll][jekyll] and [WordPress][wordpress].
