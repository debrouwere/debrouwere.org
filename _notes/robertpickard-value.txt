* Newspapers have gotten much bigger, news websites often publish more than a hundred stories per day, the media landscape has grown and it's now easier to read material from many different sources. The NYT was, on average, 14 pages daily in 1900 but a hundred years later that had risen to 88. Originally, the reason for bulking up was to convey more information to readers. Nowadays, the motivation is mainly to provide more space for advertisers, often targeted to a niche audience. But there's so much stuff that readers only read about a quarter of their newspaper on average and only spend a couple of minutes a day on their news website of choice. Advertisers obviously don't like to put ads in sections that no-one reads or on pages that people will quickly skim over. And writing all that stuff isn't free either. To cut costs, we're using ever more wire copy or shallow rewrites of stories found elsewhere â€“ but that means volume is achieved with archetypal commoditized content, making you ever more replaceable. So volume doesn't do it anymore.
* Speed. Sometimes it's nice to know instantly what's going on, on the other side of the globe or what traffic is like on a rough winter day, but most of the time, stuff that's important for people to know now will still be important for them to know next week. People don't care about instant news delivery. Inversely, they do care about not being spammed with instant updates on Facebook and Twitter. Exclusive news and scoops used to be very valuable for newspapers, but now that the web has reduced the window in which you can keep something exclusive to a couple of hours, not so much anymore either.
* Cross-platform today is more a cost of doing business than a place where you can really make a profit. Yes, you can distribute the same content on more platforms and thus lure more users, but creating tablet apps and mobile websites isn't free.
