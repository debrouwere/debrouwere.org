Who are we writing for, who is the news consumer?

The "unbanked": people who involuntarily exist outside of the financial system
The "uninformed": people who, sometimes involuntarily but most often voluntarily exist outside of traditional information systems.

- sourcing most info through friends, blogs, Facebook, Perez Hilton, ...
- bypass traditional channels
- esp. with young people

A huge percentage of <25 year olds are like this. They do get some news, but it's all filtered and there's very little hard news in there.

=> Are we creating media that resonates with people in that space? If not, what can we do to change that?

**Latoya** news orgs are interested in activating minority audiences, and younger audiences, but they don't see it as a very big problem, not something they have to act upon immediately.

In DC, there are 2 factors that screw things up
- A lot of community newspapers are not online, the printed newspaper gets passed on in Ethiopian grocery stores, community centers etc.
- Most people are getting "combination news" – neighborhood stuff, gossip, stuff from home countries, ...

For a lot of papers of color, archives mainly exist in basements etc. – nobody has the internet savvy to get that voice online and to give people from minorities more of a presence. (1) Means people from these communities have little incentive to consume news online and (2) Means people from other communities have little insight into what's happening in these communities / what life is like for these minorities?

**Marisha** are the <25y uninformed likely to stay that way, or does it relate more to a time in their life when most people are rather myopic, or is it a structural problem, something that'll haunt people throughout their life?

(Seconded by **David**. What about 30-year olds? Are those better?)

**Latoya** maybe people aren't very interested in the news and have never been, but it used to be interstitial, part of other activities (watching the news on TV, on the radio) and that's not as often the case anymore – e.g. MTV doesn't do hard news on their news breaks anymore.

**Kate** At least reddit-readers are surfing the entire internet and then curate it – so there's hope there, those are our ideal consumers.

An interesting thing PBS is doing is putting longer cuts of NewsHour on YouTube and is getting huge results from that.

**Kate** What Al Jazeera is doing is, they're trying to reach a young demographic with The Stream, but they leave it at that, whereas they should be thinking about how that ties into other programs and how they get younger people to move from "targeted" programs like that to the other coverage. 

**David** Is there any benefit to having 20-year olds informed about Libya and other non-local news? Does it help them, does it help society, and how? What's the impact?

Response by **Latoya**: the interesting thing is that most people _are_ aware of important national and international news, but they get that news from non-traditional sources, they talk about it, they have opinions about it – so it's not always about knowing / not knowing, but having objective information or having hypermediated information. Or sometimes no information when it would've been very useful to have information, e.g. in recent D.C. fights when many youths didn't even know about the curfews and the Mosquito program, and because of that, to some extent, missed an opportunity to get their voice heard because they didn't even know what was happening to them.

There's also the other problem of what David calls the "uninformative": the young talk on different channels than older people, and so they don't get their concerns heard because reporters don't know how to access these new information streams, or don't have access at all because it happens over BBM or IM or SMS.

**David** So younger people don't always want information about them to be known.

**Latoya** – well, sometimes they do, when they see they can use it as a platform to raise their concerns, e.g. during Occupy Nigeria. They want an assurance that they have some control – not necessarily over content but that their concerns are being addressed and being listened to so, get some say in what gets coverage, they aren't talking to people who will ignore them anyway.

**Kate** If you're looking at uninformed folks, people who lack modern IT infrastructure, we're doing very little to help those. Even in the US, where there are areas in the "black" south side of Chicago for example where there are no broadband internet connections.

**Bene** Monetization – it's tough to turn them into profitable customers.

**Stijn** Do people's new news habits mean they get more info or less, regardless of the time spent on it (reading at work, interstitial reading, online reading = skimming)? We're thinking of starting an effort to move news consumption to the evenings and weekends because it's more relaxed and thus people may gain more knowledge even if we put out exactly the same content.
