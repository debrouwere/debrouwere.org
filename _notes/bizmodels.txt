Notes from "The Story Thus Far" (Columbia Journalism Review) about bizmodels in news + own thoughts prompted by my reading

* potential: changing the ads you display for direct "branded" traffic (people visiting through a bookmark, logged-in users) vs. organic traffic — loyal fans have a different attention span and are also more likely to be from your core market, thus more interesting to your advertisers, and vice versa, the ads will also be more interesting to that audience because more targeted.
* distinction: product advertising (2-3 impressions / person is ideal) vs. brand advertising (6-12 impressions are ideal; hints at a sponsorship model)
* different kinds of content and websites require different kinds of ads / commercial model
* Fixed (better for mom-and-pop) vs. CPA (better for 'tweakers') vs. both (too much choice) vs. fixed and guaranteed (a fixed price, but if we don't reach the promised amount of impressions or clicks in time, we'll send you back part of the money — can be a nice segway to get back in touch with people, and tempt them to chip in some more dollars for a new campaign — "oh, I have 27 dollars left in my account, let's add another 50 and do a new campaign")
* Self-serve with live support + a phone number can be nice.
* rotating (confusing for mom-and-pop, better impression-wise) vs. exclusive (straightforward, less cognitive load for users)
* there's a lot you can do with brand equity: instead of trying to sell newspapers by bundling them with gifts, get people to buy collectibles out of appreciation
* Collectibles vs. gift shop. The first is limited in time and quantity, the second is more day-to-day and thus has lower margins but more revenue potential. The first fits better with an "I care about my neighborhood; support something nifty that's going on" model, the second is more traditional leveraging of brand equity.
* Is there double whammy potential in selling collectibles, e.g. by letting a local merchant handle the distribution, and getting them to pay for getting people in your store?
* paying newsletters vs. ad-supported ones?
* sponsored tweets or FB messages? Maybe these can work if you get the copywriting just right (and will work better within a community, because you're advertising another business that is also part of the community, so it's more like a traditional shout-out)
* more old-fashioned sponsorship copywriting in general: an authentic message by the presenter thanking the sponsors vs. a slick commercial
* "working with what you have" vs. "reinventing": at one point, trying to find good business models for news is hampered not by the fact that it's impossible, but that you have to work within a certain framework of having certain journalists with certain skills, a sales force and managerial corps you can't well get rid of, etc. and this limits what you can do. For example, good journalists should be able to give a social media course like it's nothing, but most journalists nowadays still can't properly use it themselves. Not only does that make you miss out on opportunities to make better journalism, but also business potential. Instead of being able to offer trainings to the general public, we have to put money into training our own journalists.
* When doing audience research, make sure to remove outliers and bin the remainder into groups, otherwise you'll get no insight whatsoever — average time on site for all users is a meaningless metric.
* Issue-based coverage may lead to potentially lucrative print products, whether it is small paperbacks or getting people to buy this week's magazine [insert in weekend paper] with its special report on this stuff. (Which may also have longer-lasting value, allowing you to sell your backlog for at least a month or two after publication.) This stuff may be marketable to people who wouldn't otherwise go for a full subscription anyway, so you're trying to extract more value from this segment too.
* Finishability!
* Regularly (more than once a month, per city) make a Kickstarter/spot.us project to give people a way to support great community journalism in their neighborhood and be a part of something that's bigger than them, and that needs them to work (due to the all-or-nothing process), and that they can get rewarded for (even if it's just with a thank-you card) but without asking them directly for money to support *all* of our journalism. You can price these projects somewhat higher than their actual cost so the money can also partially flow to other journalism or to the administrative support.
* If you can make videos of local bands playing their stuff, can you also sell CDs or MP3s with that content on it?
* Could you make a profitable Kindle (or even iPad) package with a cheap subscription, and make money off that, because it puts an interface in people's hands that is easier to monetize later on (e.g. through daily digests sent to your Kindle, both automatically and based on stuff you click 'read later' on)?
* Services and events and workshops: really require (1) a well-trained, modern staff so we can actually pull this off and have it be a meaningful service instead of a fraud and (2) our own space, to get as much of the pie as we can and for branding purposes and rent-outs. But there's potential here.
* Event-wise, use the brand to e.g. negotiate lower prices with bands, and use staff expertise to pick and promote up-and-coming (cheap) gems. Our brand makes it easier for us to be a kick-ass event organiser, not harder, and that's what we should be looking for.
* Local deals have gotten a bad rep lately, but I think there's way to make money off 'em in a way that's fair and benefits both the retailers and the paper.
* The general message is that you can still make money with journalism, but the business models are becoming more complex and multi-faceted. What are some other types of businesses that depend on complex business models?
	- non-profits 
	(fundraising is an arcane art, they're constantly trying out new stuff)
	- musicians
	(seek eyeballs with audio, but make money with concerts)
	- speakers/experts
	(no money on writing, lots of money on speaking engagements and consulting)

Properties of advertising that pairs up great with community journalism: 

* BRAND ADVERTISING: it's important that the advertising emphasizes the advertiser is part of the community, that they're great guys you want to business with; direct sales are not that important.
* TARGETED & ENGAGED: advertisers get a local audience that doesn't just drive by, but that is a loyal reader who cares about relevant commercial messages, just like people do in a print magazine.
* TASTEFUL & ENJOYABLE: Some ads actively harm your brand by being seedy or annoying. We don't. We practice permission marketing instead, for example by asking people whether we can send them a reminder about today's special or next week's event — ads can be useful.
* TRANSPARENT: We offer people fixed prices so there's not too much knob-turning involved to get started, but we also give advertisers the hard numbers about how many people saw and clicked the ad, and help you improve those numbers.
