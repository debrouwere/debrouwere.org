==> It might be interesting to illustrate all these spectrums and dichotomies using a range of anecdotes or stories, so as to really explain the breadth of journalism as well as the breadth of our information needs. I'll have to keep it engaging considering there's no real "point" to this outline, it's simply a bunch of facts that may be useful when building information products -- to see what kind of decisions you'll have to make (or that will be made without you realizing it).


Note that this is really about much more than journalism. It's about what kinds of information there are, what functions each type fills, and when we're likely to seek them out.

What kind of journalism are there?

* news updates (this happened)
* advice (reviews, how-tos, recipes, ...)
* information about environment: calendars, classifieds, ...
* stories (the writing is the value)
* trend stories, explanations, analysis (in the abstract sense of the term: stories that explain a bigger phenomenon or bring it to light)
* exposing corruption (important for bringing things to light; but gains in importance if people get upset about it or if it actually embarrasses / harms the perps, not if it gets lost amongst the news stream) [this *can* be an information need, but sometimes it's more of a social need, where we only want to be reassured that someone is keeping the powerful to account, not necessarily hear about individual cases of that happening except sometimes as "proof."]
* ?

What kinds of news serve what kinds of information needs? Which kinds of news are still useful? Which can be catered to in other ways?

“We’re giving a lot of thought to three different kinds of consumption: Active consumption being at the desktop, on-the-go consumption being on your mobile phone, and passive consumption being in your bed, on your tablet, something like that,” Callie Schweitzer (TPM) said.

What are people hiring us to do, at least in terms of “journalistic news”?  I suspect the way people access news is still evolving – and it’s not like anyone really knows the answer now anyway – but I might argue that there are a couple of discrete user behaviors/needs: News, search, context and serendipity.  News meaning simply getting people the latest updates on important stuff (who won the French election?); search meaning fulfilling specific information needs when people want it (how many people died when the Titanic went down?); context meaning helping people understand issues, whether about news or broader topics  (so what is climate change and how does it affect me?); and serendipity meaning telling people things they might need to know but don’t know they need to know (end of the world next Tuesday!)

Situations / user stories

"I don't understand this particular story."
"God, I need a break. Let's surf around."
"There seems to be a lot going on in politics. Need to check the news so I don't look clueless when it comes up with friends or colleagues."
"Just woke up. Let's see what happened while I was asleep."
"This weather looks nasty. Wonder whether I can bike to work."
"That story I read yesterday about that court case was really interesting. Wonder whether there's a follow-up."
"Sunday morning. Coffee and a good magazine. Aah."
"Wonder whether there's anything to do next weekend."
"I saw something about new education legislation online, but I couldn't understand half of it. Wonder whether I can find something more in-depth online."
"I saw something about new education legislation online, and I'm worried about how it impacts me, but I don't know."
"Time to get my daily education fix. Wonder what people are talking about."
"God, I'm bored. Let's check the news."
"Back from work, went to the gym, had dinner, and now it's time to relax."
"I need to keep on top of what's happening with the global economy. It's my job, after all."
"A friend of mine said something about new taxes. What is that all about?"
"I read a story a while back about the Atkins diet. Let me try and look it up again, because I want to reread it."

TODO: once I think I've collected most all meaningful facets / behaviors, match these with media products and non-media products that are geared towards people or simply appeal to people when they're in that particular mood.

TODO: are there meaningful differences between men and women, just like there are between younger and older consumers?

Also make some educated guesses as to what moods / facets / time of consumption often cluster together.

"a consumer might start his or her day by opening an e-mail news headline package, then click on a head- line and move to a story. But then what? What happens later when the story develops? How do critical questions about the back story get answered? Where can the user go for a look ahead, or for spin-offs that are more personally relevant?" (AP, A new model for news, p. 56, 2008)


Modeling information need

- short stories and faits divers as a form of light reading (daily routine, same reason comics are one of the first things people check out when waking up, the fact that it's non-fiction is not even very important.)
- keeping up to date
  - for its own sake
  - as a framework to life ("what's happening around me?")
  - to be able to participate in watercooler conversation
  - as social currency
- catching up / the basics (learn more about important issues or issues your friends or peers are talking about)
- looking for specific information (specific question about something)
- reading more in-depth material (knowledge)
- reading stories (enjoyment)
- minute-by-minute information (for topics you really care about, e.g. macrumors.com)

We need to design better website flows to accomodate these diverse information needs, and make sure people find the type of content that is most appropriate to their needs at the moment intuitively.

We don't know what our users want, and the mistake of chasing "quality" (cf. Robert Pickard)

general modes of news consumption

* enjoying
* learning
  - about the world
  - about my world
  - research (in-depth, not just "find out a little more")
* engaging / talking / socializing / showcasing own expertise
  - with author/expert
  - with a community
* producing
  - expression
  - sharing
  - self-assertion
  - advocacy

consumer <--> producer
leisurely <--> engaged
knowledge <--> entertainment
facts <--> opinion: what to think / how to feel
deep <--> superficial / need-to-know
accurate <--> diligent when possible **
individual <--> social
new perspectives <--> strengthen beliefs
stuff that affects me <--> a view on another world *
exploration <--> depth
urgent / need right now / recency <--> general interest
visual <--> textual

* why people read about politics, I'd wager
** subtly different from wanting depth: in some cases it's very important that you have very accurate, precise information whereas in other cases you might want to get very in-depth information about a topic but you're not going to care if a name is spelled wrong.

For some things, like finding good music, a recipe, something to do this weekend but also figuring out what happened today or last week... for all those things we usually just want a general sort of overview and it's easy for services (journalism or no) to be "good enough." An interesting avenue for journalism might be to figure out what kinds of knowledge we care about beyond just "good enough", or what audience cares about more than good enough, and try to build products around that. I don't mean investigative journalism, though certainly some kinds of investigative journalism might fit the bill.

This is important for new news organizations: figure out what sort of news (or other information need) people consider to be fungible and which types of information they don't look at in that way. When people value quality you can compete on quality. When they don't, it's pointless, and instead you have to compete on efficiency or secondary characteristics (e.g. social element to turn it into something that's not fungible anymore).

Why do you think there are so many mediocre websites with business listings in small towns? Because people want to find a phone number for that Thai place or a gas station or the nearest flower shop, and they honestly don't care where they find it and how good or crappy the site they find it on looks. Which means it's the ideal project for entrepreneurs who want to make a quick buck and care nothing about improving local communities. Just put some databases on the web and slap huge ads on top of them, and you're done. People don't care. It's good enough.

It's not that you can't compete with these sites (e.g. Yelp does, successfully), but you have to realize exactly how you'll add value, and realize that it's not about doing a better job or creating a sleek website or wonderful user experience, but about providing value, providing something people actually miss.

(Note that it's not impossible to create new habits in users, and maybe get them to care about something they don't care about right now and to act differently than they do now to certain types of journalism products... but if that's your goal, you need to be a 100% aware of it, because that's an entirely different challenge from the "write it and they will come" you can expect when playing to people's existing desires and catering to what they are "hiring you to do.")

I suspect that we may see a hollowing-out of the news genre spectrum, but in a good way: the latest news in short bits on the one hand (and made more sensible to irregular readers) and proper long-form plus focused apps plus campaigns against specific wrongs on the other hand... but none of the "we called three people, looked at a data set and we'll call that investigative reporting" or "here's an article about a big issue that we will from now on never talk about again." So you'd cater to the people that want to know what's going on today (short), the people that want to know what's going on in the/their world (long) and the people that want to be entertained or sit back and relax (video shows).

(Long is not necessarily always investigative, or even most of the time -- it can be about showing people inspiring stuff, telling stories, doing interviews with people your audience deeply cares about... and in all of those cases there's less of a reason to do follow-ups, because the impact that sort of content has on your life is more cumulative, more about giving you stuff to think about and shaping how you look at the world. But if you *do* do investigative or expose corruption or address a problem in society, you need to go all-in, not just write about it once and tell yourself you've done everything you could.)

Knight information needs

* coordinate (to get anything done, to organize events)
* solve problems (identify goals and challenges, prioritize, band together)
* establish systems of public accountability
* develop a sense of connectedness

Tom Rosenstiel's eight/nine functions of journalism

http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102533/Creating-a-Navigational-Guide-to-New-Media.aspx

* witness bearer (be present when other people are not)
* authenticator
* sensemaker
* investigator/watchdog
* empowerer (give people a way to do something with the information they get)
* community builder
* forum organizer (facilitate conversation across communities)
* role model (in a world of self-publishers, show people how it's done)
* aggregator

Steve Yelvington

* Be well-informed on matters of civic importance in my community
* Reading the news is a pleasant and entertaining activity.
* It gives me something to talk about at lunch with my coworkers.
* While reading the paper, I discover what's on sale at my local stores.
* Sometimes I see stuff about people I know.
* I want to feel like I'm part of a community.

Max Novendstern

* The J.S. Mill Thesis: We read the news because it’s our duty as citizens. We have the privilege of voting, and of participating in the governance of our country, and we take that task seriously.
* The Gawker Thesis: We read the news because we think it’s fun. Our relationship to politics is roughly the same as the video gamer’s relationship to video games.
* The Habermas Thesis: We read the news because it gives us something to talk about. The news is part of our “public discourse,” our set of shared intellectual touchstones that help to affirm our membership in communities like campus and country. We value that.
* The Ida Tarbell Thesis: We read the news because we have principles and personal projects, and “getting the facts” help us achieve our goals. I care about climate change because I want to stop it. I need to know about ethanol policy because my job depends on it. Etc.
* The Chomsky Thesis: We read the news because powerful people lie, and it’s our “responsibility as intellectuals” to expose those lies.

Amy Zerba (collated from various academic research; publication in Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 2011)

* reading for the sake of reading, whether for stimulation or respite, or as a ritual in one’s day
* social prestige (knowing a lot) and social contact (being able to talk to others)
* security (feeling secure because you know what's happening around you, you're not in the dark)

formats

* stories
* data apps
* shows (video, podcast)

The web gives people access to many services they used to need a newspaper for. Trash pickup schedules on the city's website, new music to know about on Pandora, recipes on allrecipes.com, tutorials on YouTube and you could keep going. Add to that thousands of niche communities, Facebook groups and free publications about everything from gardening to 3d printing. Top that off with easy access to competing local and regional newspapers. [link to previous post about this]

The question is no longer "do our readers and viewers like more business, and what about lifestyle and outdoors?" The question is more fundamentally: what do people still use newspapers for, and why do they visit news websites? Surveys have no answer to that question. Surveys can tell us to do a little bit more of this or that, not whether what we're doing even makes any sense at all.

THOUGHTS

* Never be afraid to go for the low-hanging fruit. There's a shit-ton of issues that people know about but don't understand or don't see the importance of, so taking seriously our civic duties as journalist does not have to mean four-month investigations. Explain what's already known, because mainstream media sure as hell isn't doing it.
* Another way to put it: the first priority is making sure people are better informed about things that affect their lives, because people's current news consumption patterns lead to an audience that learns very haphazardly. Only once you've got that figured out does it make sense to start thinking about what stories are not being told, what sort of stuff media has been consistently bad at shining a light on... and addressing that problem
* Question: is news that you can't fit into a broader issue and will likely never come back to... is that kind of news ever really valuable or interesting? (Not talking about features or sports, which are different.)

AXES OF ENGAGEMENT

EFFICIENT			RELAXED
summaries	soundbites	analysis
headlines	overviews	contributing

INFORMED					NEW

efficient coverage	reminders		"background"
depth			Q&A			timelines
discuss						up-to-speed
share expertise

REGULARS					PASSER-BYS

debate			personalization		just the news
social identity		keep track		efficiency (summaries & Q&A)


It's tempting to conflate all this to "into it" and "not into this", but that's not accurate and each group requires its own strategies. You can be an uninformed regular, and a passer-by in a relaxed reading state, and all the other permutations.
