Ever since my college years at the "student newspaper":http://schamper.ugent.be/, I've been captivated by the publishing industry and its challenges. Workflows. Cross-platform publishing and web-to-print. Layout automation. Metadata management. Digitizing paper archives. Nerd stuff, but it fascinates me to no end.

I started out as a script kiddie when I was twelve or thirteen, hacking away many a late night at crummy PHP scripts. After graduating from college, I took the time to learn how to code properly, and picked up Python. Ended up as a freelancer mostly by accident, then a media consultant. Currently back to working for the man, at The Gazette and KCRG â€“ a local newspaper and TV station in America's heartland.

I have a masters degree in philosophy. Most philosophy happens to be unscientific bullshit, but waiving that, it's a riveting field of study. I love John Dewey.

I went to college in Ghent (Belgium) and must've lived there for six or seven years, moved to London for a while, then back to Belgium. Right now, I live in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a city that, its citizens tell me, is only a four-hour drive away from many interesting places.

If you're wondering how to pronounce my name, it's probably because you can't. That's okay, I don't mind.
