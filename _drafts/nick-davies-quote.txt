Microsoft had asked us to come up with an alternative to 'Where Do You Want To Go Today?' (which is easily the best line they could ever have hoped for.)

And we spent ages generating all these horrible, bland taglines. And then I called someone, I can't remember who, Bank of America or AT&T, about some problem. And the lady on the line said 'we're as disappointed as you are' about some failure of their's and it struck me as the perfect corporate tagline for the 21st century.

Just that sense that everything they do is out of their own hands. Don't blame us, we're a huge, rubbish corporation, it's out of ours hands, we have no choice but to let you down with shoddy products and poor service. Still, we're as disappointed as you are, so please continue to shop with us.
