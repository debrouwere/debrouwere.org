permission to translate

Dear <>, 

I love your work and was wondering if I could translate one of your blog posts, <>, into Dutch?

The US has such vibrant discussions about the future of journalism, but because of the language barrier the resulting insights are not finding their way into local discourse here in Belgium and the Netherlands.

I've taken it upon myself to translate some of the very best work into Dutch, to be published on my own blog with proper attribution and a short bio. I'd love it if your work could be a part of that series.

Thanks for your consideration.

Best, 
Stijn

permission to translate a blogpost

Dear <>, 

I read <> a while back, thought it was really insightful and was wondering if I could translate it into Dutch? It'd appear on my own blog (stdout.be) and potentially mediakritiek.be, with proper attribution and a short bio.

Thanks for your consideration.

Best, 
Stijn
