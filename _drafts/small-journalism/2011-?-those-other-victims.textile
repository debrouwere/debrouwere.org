A lesson about how photographers have become less important in journalism, which is sometimes sad, but is often for good reason (amateurs can take better pictures now + the call for quality images is not as great as we think) yet almost nobody ever complains about the decline of good (local, nat'l, not foreign) newspaper photography. The industry is moving on, we've accepted it, and photographers may often cringe at the photography they see in their local paper (next to their own beautiful shots, which we still do for covers and important people) but they accept it too.

Part of getting out of the news industry crisis is accepting new realities, in which less people may have a job and others may do different jobs, and different people (sometimes just ordinary citizens, or experts) may do those jobs instead of professional journalists.

We need to separate the essential (good reporting about stuff that matters) from the incidental (saving newspapers). Not a new message but it pays to repeat it every once in a while.

And if the difference is that it's the reporters that contribute directly to Democracy, why is every half-famous person interviewed at least once a month, why do people mass around parliament to gather identical soundbites or photos, why do newspapers all write stuff that's so similar? It seems to me that we can do the same with less people. Maybe even do a little bit more.
