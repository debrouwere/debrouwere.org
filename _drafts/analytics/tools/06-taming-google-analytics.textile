* explain the different levels of metrics (page, session, visitor) and the limitations they impose on the sort of queries you can do
* show how to add custom variables and events
* show how to build a couple of actionable metrics using custom reports
* show how the API works (examples + a 'getting started' skeleton in a gist or open-source project or something) and warn people about how clunky it is to work with


CAN DO

- track custom variables
- track individual users (you can't identify them, but you can do stuff like figure out the amount of users that visited at least four times a month)
- funnel analysis

CAN'T DO

- no per-user metrics (many of them are sampled and then averaged) and thus no 
- cohort analysis (important for good over-time performance metrics that don't conflate new users' response to a design change with existing users' response -- which you don't want to just average out like most analytics software does)
- act on analytics: you may be able to detect patterns in the analytics and change your site to improve those metrics, which is worth a lot, but you can't do things like send lifecycle emails to users that are likely to leave the service

MAYBE

- for users that haven't visited in more than a month, figure out what they viewed on their last visit?
- creating user profiles (because only the premium version of Google Analytics gives access to raw data, drawing precise correlations between e.g. reading preferences and retention might be impossible --- but OTOH, if you track e.g. how much stories an anon user reads in each section through custom variables, ) Trouble is: five custom variables is a pittance when you need to really segment your users (one variable for each topic you cover could already get you up to 10)
- check whether there are loyal users (> 10 visits per month) that visit primarily through social media, or whether there's a strong correlation between organic traffic and loyalty

There are some things that software like Google Analytics should theoretically be able to track, but I don't know if you can actually get the sort of data you need out of it.

For example, the percentage of your visitors that visit often and that enter at least 75% of the time through social media.

For example, the percentage of first-time visitors that become loyal readers within a month. And then, for those visitors, how they entered (social media, homepage, ...) and what kind of content they viewed (more sports, more politics, more ...) --- The data is all there, but Google Analytics' filtering options in their UI as well as API are rather more rudimentary than that.

You can get somewhere... [untested]
