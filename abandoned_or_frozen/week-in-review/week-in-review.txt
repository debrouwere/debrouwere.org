I was chatting with my better half a while back, about how advertising will radically change in the next five to ten years, and that it won't continue to support the media industry to the extent that it does now. She fired back a simple question, namely: "why?" To which I responded, lamely, "eh, because, eh, advertisers will find better ways of spending their marketing budget; because the web gives advertisers a ton of new ways to reach their audience." Lame, because, honestly, after reading through a ton of blogposts and magazine articles on advertising, you'd expect an answer that goes beyond vague assertions.

I've read a ton of books lately and I've amassed over 1,000 bookmarks on Delicious in less than a year. And the sad part: I honestly don't remember 90% of what I've read. There's a huge wealth of information out there, waiting to be consumed, which makes it incredibly enticing to just skim over even the most insightful commentary, thinking that a quick glance will get you the gist. And maybe it does, but it doesn't stick.

For me, the best way to collect and order my thoughts is by writing them down. That's why I started this blog. Writing stuff down is also one of the best ways to really make sure you _grasp_ what you're reading, and maybe to remember things a tad bit longer.

So, with that introduction: from now on, every couple of weeks, I'll do a review of what I've read, and post it here. A review, not just the links. First one's up tomorrow, so stay tuned!
