To Daniel Bachhuber, responding to http://www.grist.org/living/2011-06-28-the-medium-chill: 

I could care less about a successful career, and the only material possessions in my life I care about are my musical instruments... but I do care about making a dent, both out of sheer vanity and because it feels kind of nice to be able to say you've done something in your life that has made other people's life more enjoyable. The difficult problem then becomes not how to stop caring about money, but how to balance the good you can do in your immediate environment simply by being there for people and enjoying each other's company, and the good you can do through working hard for organizations that matter. That's a tougher nut to crack.
