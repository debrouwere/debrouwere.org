## SOME SOLUTIONS ##

*Some solutions*

1. More peer-to-peer discussion, using social platforms e.a.; maybe also the basis for outsiders to find the actual IT / open data guys inside orgs
2. Knowledge exchange deals
3. Success stories (intern + ivm. WOB requests + externe apps)
4. Best practices & guidelines: how to tell if data could violate people's privacy? what should open data look like, what determines its quality? how can you capture data from your current processes if all you've currently got is an unstructured hodge-podge of data; what is worth opening up (more than you think!); some notes about licensing
5. Lobby for gov't support higher-up if you want to see innovation on the local level
6. Challenges / prizes can quickly produce a lot of good applications, that can serve as inspiration and get people to notice open data and what it can do
7. Allow (and encourage) government departments to take things one step at a time: first get departments to start thinking more data-centrically in order to improve their own knowledge management, then open up some of their datasets to other departments, then maybe tell the public that this data exists and that they can request it (leaving them with a choice on whether to grant access), and if that proves successful, open things up entirely. Once they've taken that first step, we're already well on the road to open data nirvana.

* They should feel in charge.
* Wedstrijden kunnen een goede manier zijn om snel veel potentieel te tonen
* Henk: how about an exchange: we give you the tools and knowledge to do data mining and create a pretty website, but then we DO want the structured data, which civil servants should enter and maintain
* Fine-grained control about which data they open up -- the first step is getting their data organized, the second step is opening up
* Commercial application: shouldn't be seen as a threat

random remarks
--------------

* gov'ts are trying to put a lot of information online, to help out people, but that leads to a proliferation of websites that then have to be marketed -- but shouldn't the government be trying to get that information to the websites where the people already are!! This would save money + can make commercial sense (somebody from gov't itself -- cf. gov.united)
