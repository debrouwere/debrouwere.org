A manifesto for a better way of doing journalism
------------------------------------------------

Be real. Think value. Be lean. Serve.

## Save journalism, not journalists

° There is only us

If journalism is about connecting and informing people, then that's a job for each and every one of us — not just for professional journalists. We need students, public servants, citizens, politicians and educators to be blogging about what they see and what they think. We need experts in law, economics and science to help us make sense of all the changes and tumult our society is going through. We need parents and fellow city dwellers to join the discussion. We need people who can stay neutral, and others who argue with verve and passion for their own point of view. There is only us — everybody should be a journalist.

° The journalist is the brand

The best journalists don't need to adapt to the future, because they're already actively helping shape it. They make themselves indispensable to the organizations they work for because they bring their own audience, because they promote their own work, because they have a unique way of writing or because of their incredible amount of insight into a niche topic. They know storytelling requires different tools for different stories, so they know how to handle a DSLR, know how to shoot and edit video and audio, and know how to crowdsource.

There are too many journalists out there, and they earn slave wages. A journalist who can turn himself into a strong brand can set his own price.  And publishers will be happy to pay.

° It's about the ecosystem, not about you

Reporters and newspapers are adamant about the fact that they're the fourth estate, that they're the quintessential public good. Well, time to prove it! Where are those contributions to Wikipedia? Do you participate in any debates outside of your own news organization? Do you support citizen initiatives? Do you lobby for open data and open government? Do you support  students when they're researching topics that are important to the communities you serve? We will.

° Writing about stuff is most exciting when you're actually _doing_ stuff

We like it that journalists try to keep a distance from the things they cover. But we also love the fact that experts, professors, citizens, professionals and public servants are speaking up, and telling us their take on things. They might not be objective, but they're transparant as can be about their biases, and that's really all we care for. The vigor and insight that comes with talking about something that keeps you occupied from dusk till dawn will beat the hasty reporting of an overworked journalist any time. We'll decide for ourselves how much of a partisan you really are.

## We are servants

° Wikifying the news

News is a natural byproduct of context and background. News is not enough. Readers often lack the context behind news stories. Not because they're stupid but because we refuse to provide it to them, instead choosing to focus on short "exclusives" with no lasting value. We 

° We're a service, not a product

We care about you, and we want to make a meaningful impact on your life and foster the communities you live in. That means we're not just in the business of writing stories. Everything we can do to help you out is part of our business. Applications that tell you where the living is good. Helping you communicate with the government. Helping you find stuff with local directories, and helping you understand stuff with wiki's.

° Journalism is a conversation

Journalism is a conversation between people. We need to drop the vapid news voice and start talking and writing like humans again. Guess what: it's not because you write from a neutral point of view that you're actually neutral. Don't try to fool readers into thinking that you are. We, the reader, actually want your perspective on things and your opinion. And we'd rather have it out in the open so we can figure out for ourselves whether to trust you.

° Transparency is the new objectivity

Newspapers are proud of their independent reporting and adherence to strict ethical standards in their reporting. Yet they're incredibly secretive about what they do, and expect our blind trust in their professionalism. That's not going to cut it anymore. We want journalists to list all their sources and the documents that form the basis of their reporting. We want reporters to tell us what they _don't_ know.

## Lean and mean

° Curate, don't rewrite

We refuse to do even the least bit of work that doesn't add to the conversation. So we won't waste money rewriting stuff that's already out there, but we'll curate the best of the web. We love to send you off to our competition, because after all, we're trying to serve you as best we can. And they're not really our competition anyway — we're all in this together.

In print, we adopt the same ethos: don't do shoddy reporting in areas that are outside your newsroom's expertise. License the best that's out there, translate pieces from kindred organizations, include the best content from blogs all across the world. We're a new generation of news makers, we live in a globalized world and we won't settle for mediocrity.

° Make do

Foreign bureaus are great. Enterprise reporting is amazing. Luxurious print layouts are wonderful. But it' doesn't help anyone to be bitching about how the market doesn't pay for quality. Let's figure out what we can do with what we have. Let's figure out how to monetize quality. Let's not beg the government for a pony, when we haven't even figured out what kind of quality we can achieve with the money that's available to us.

° Demos, not memos

We're not going to spend days discussing the merits and pitfalls of twenty different approaches to this or that. We're going to hack something up, test it out, and take careful measurements to see if it's working out or not. We're going to experiment and we're going to fail often, and yet we'll still come out ahead of any media org that's in perpetual-meeting-mode. We'll have more fun, too. And because we take care to actually test and measure what we do, as lean businesses should, we'll learn from our mistakes.

° Get everybody in the newsroom

We're in the information business: journalism is about empowering people by giving them the knowledge they need to be responsible citizens. It's also about telling people what's going on in their neighborhood, so they can live life to its fullest. If we're to achieve those lofty goals, we're going to need all the talent that's out there. Coders, statisticians, graphic designers, information architects, writers and editors should all be a part of our newsrooms.

We're doing away with silos. Everybody is responsible with producing great journalism, and all of these people should be talking to each other and working together. It'll be messy, but it'll pay off.

## Technology at the center

° Don't let a person do a computer's job


° When computers and humans help each other out, we're unstoppable

Computers are stupid and so are we. Human reporters too often have to do menial jobs — scouring the internet for tidbits and sources, finding out what's hot. Computers on their own provide fairly little value as well — the twitter daily news app is cute and Planet Aggregators serve their use, but nobody gets excited over them. But create workflows where computers enhance human functioning, or let humans guide computer reasoning, and sparks fly.

## Better business

° Redefine "ad" to "add value"

We believe in meaningful advertising. We believe in helping business communicate with our readers, and in getting readers to actually enjoy that experience. We don't believe in information assymetries: advertisers and sponsors should get detailed stats on how well their campaigns are faring, and the best advice we can give them on how to make the most out of the least amount of their budget.

We also won't game the system by pushing pageviews, because we don't care about pageviews. Instead we look for reader engagement. We want _the right kinds_ of pageviews.

° Don't be afraid of making money

Enkel overheidssteun en steun van lezers voor die projecten die een concreet aantoonbaar publiek goed zijn; en die functie als publiek goed ook écht uitvoeren (API's, services, soms zelfs lobbying)

° Scarcity ain't coming back

° The Ten O'Clock news is just the icing

Mensen betalen voor specialistische content, niet voor hetgeen je overal toch al kan krijgen. (Rusbridger speech v. Guardian; SteveOuting post)
