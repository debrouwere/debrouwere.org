So, I've been on twitter for [about an hour] now, after I vowed to myself I'd never ever create an account, never ever cave in.

Twitter just doesn't mesh with my way of thinking, my way of communicating with people.

But then, I do consider myself to be a publisher, and publishers go where their audience wants them to be, not where they'd rather be. I mean, there's limits. I don't think I'll ever write information architecture haikus, and let's keep that videoblog in the freezer for now... but when the message trumps the medium, swallow my pride I must.

If you look at my Delicious account, you'll see that I've been tweeting for well over two years now. I've just thought of it as adding commentary to the things I bookmark. Thing is: I love to see my old notes on things I've bookmarked, but nobody else ever sees them, because nobody else seems to be on Delicious anymore. I tried to turn the tide: -- link to dead accounts --. They wouldn't listen, the damn damn fools!

And I'd been occassionally following other people's tweetstreams as well, to see what colleagues are up to.

And I would prefer people to e-mail me and have real conversations, at the very least respond in full as a comment when they do a blogpost... but then, it's been a while since I've emailed someone about his or her latest provocative blogpost myself. So I'd been fooling myself a little bit, it seems. (No doubt of course that I'm still fooling myself right now. Rationalization does that to people.)

On the other hand, I will rot in hell before I fight out an argument on twitter or post one-sentence-at-a-time essays, like some of you weirdos do.  To hell with your ironic hashtags. And my blog is and for the forseeable future will remain my most prized posession.
