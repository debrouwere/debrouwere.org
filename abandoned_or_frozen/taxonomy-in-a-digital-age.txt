Taxonomy in a digital age
-------------------------

Taxonomy is hard. That's the first thing you'll likely hear when talking to information professionals of any pedigree — IA's, usability experts, librarians, even bona fide taxonomists. And it is. But the chief reason taxonomy is hard is because we've made it so. We've been overly occupied by one-size-fits-all taxonomies.

Faceted classification (using different taxonomies and other metadata together) and ontologies can solve a lot of headaches and help you find elegant ways of categorizing information.

But both facets and ontologies require that we move beyond taxonomies as we know them. We've been operating within restrictions that hardly ever make sense anymore.

In the physical world, everything has to be in one place. In the physical world, there's a clear difference between an object and its metadata. In the physical world, labels are smaller than the thing they label. In the digital world, none of those precepts hold true anymore.

There is a universal acid that strips away most presuppositions about how a well-formed taxonomy should look, and allows us to move on. Just ask yourself one simple question, courtesy of David Weinberger: are you limiting yourself and your categorization schemes because it makes sense, or because your thinking is stuck in physical metaphors?

* "there can be many classification systems to govern the relationship of content along many dimensions." (http://contentstrategy.rsgracey.com/2010/06/18/taxonomy-disambiguation/)
* Don't confuse categories with entities. You may be inclined to include persons or organizations in a taxonomy, but don't. Limit taxonomies to abstract terms, and use linked data to connect content to its related persons, organizations, places and/or events though metadata.
* Educational policy is about both education and politics. We shouldn't be forced to choose a single parent term. The digital world means we can leave behind strict monohierarchical taxonomies, and take advantage of polyhierarchies.
* It's often more natural to be able to describe how _things_ _relate_ to other _things_, not how _content_ is _classified_ with _terms_. So think beyond categorization. The digital world makes it easy to connect content through ontologies. A news story might talk about a person who is a member of a certain political party. So codify that information, instead of seeing political parties and persons as nothing more than 'terms' in a vocabulary. http://thetaxonomyblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/skills-of-a-classy-taxonomist/

Avoiding hybrid taxonomies
==========================

A lot of taxonomies combine abstract concepts with concrete entities like places or persons or organizations. So, for example, the ``Politics`` term in a vocabulary might have ``House of Representatives`` and ``White House`` as subterms. This makes sense if a single taxonomy is the only available form of categorization. However, with the general move towards more and more faceting (different kinds of vocabularies and other metadata that together describe each piece of content), such hybrid taxonomies can quickly become a mess.

There's no reason to include things like organizations in a thematic taxonomy if they're already defined as entities in a broader ontology. In that case, you'd be better off being able to categorize these entities like persons and places with certain themes, but in the same way as you would categorize any other *content*, not as part of the thematic taxonomy itself.

Splitting up a hybrid taxonomy into a purely conceptual taxonomy, and supplementing that taxonomy with an entity-based approach makes both the taxonomy and the ontology that contains the entities more maintainable. This two-pronged approach also makes for a better tie-in with text mining solutions, who use different algorithms to detect entities than they do to detect taxonomy terms.

A practical example.

The House of Representatives and the Senate are, in the broad sense of that word, organizations. Organizations can resort under other organizations, in this case the U.S. Congress. Organizations can have members, and can be or not be disbanded. ``House of Representatives`` is thus not just a label, it is an entity in itself with a whole bunch of properties that an abstract concept like ``transport`` lacks. You may want to assign some themes to entities, to place them in a certain "semantic sphere". In this case, the most specific subject matter that you'll ever want or need is probably ``local government``. Purely conceptual taxonomies can be smaller, which makes them easier to maintain.

By putting entities in a semantic sphere, the themes for each piece of content get fed through both regular term extraction from the content, but also indirectly through terms associated with entities from that content. This two-pronged approach should lead to better and more consistent categorization.

Ontology
========

In the physical world, everything has to be in one place. In the physical world, there's a clear difference between an object and its metadata, which might be written down somewhere on an index card. In the physical world, labels are smaller than the thing they label.

In digital repositories, many limitations of the physical world are rendered void. They should no longer inform how we construct taxonomies or our broader metadata strategy.

For example, things can be in more than one place, so utilizing multiple complementary taxonomies (genre, theme, sentiment et cetera) is a no-brainer. Not only can content be associated with multiple terms ("this story is about both education and culture"), but terms can be associated with multiple parent terms as well (``education`` could reside under both ``society`` and ``culture``). That way, taxonomies are better able to capture the richness of the content, and don't have to force it into boxes it might not fit — a criticism often leveled against old-school taxonomy.

Another idea we inherited from the physical world is that labels are smaller than the thing they label. Now, though, it would serve us better if we would stop making a hard distinction between *data* and *metadata*.

When linking content to a relevant person, it makes sense to have a person be an `actual entity with certain properties <http://stdout.be/2010/tags-dont-cut-it/>`_ instead of just a term in a taxonomy. A person has a first name, a last name, maybe an associated profile or short bio, associated photographs, he or she may work for or belong to certain organizations and so on. It makes sense to model some of these properties of persons, organizations, events and documents in software. It might e.g. be very useful for a reader to consult the profile page for president Obama, and find a short bio and related content alongside links to the Democratic Party, to Chicago, to a topical page about national politics and so on. Thinking in terms of entities instead of labels, is the first step towards creating rich topical pages that can keep readers browsing through your sites instead of clicking away.

If this all sounds too abstract: it's like having your own variants on `CrunchBase <www.crunchbase.com>`_ for persons, companies, organizations, local places in Iowa and so on, and using links to these databases as contextual information to any story you write. You can see these entity databases in use at `TechCrunch <http://techcrunch.com/>`_, although there's more potential in ontologies than what you'll see there.

My recommendation on taxonomy construction is simple: use polyhierarchical taxonomies to indicate abstract topics and themes, but use ontologies for everything else.

	1) tja, ten eerste, goed na te denken en niet te snel 'poly' te gaan
	2) belangrijker: een primaire ouder aan te duiden, zodat je mensen
