[keep it short]

Dear X Y, 

<intro & vraag om medewerking>

I don't know if my name has ever crossed your radar, but I did a modestly influential series on information architecture for news websites last year: http://stdout.be/2010/04/06/information-architecture-for-news-websites/ When I wrote it, I figured it'd just be an idea dump, but I've since noticed that people keep using it as some sort of a reference... which scares me a little. But then again, there isn't any reference or a book about IA for news, so it's not surprising that people take what they can get.

...

We could surely do an e-book and dead-tree book as well, but I think a free online version is key, especially for people in our industry who make money, first and foremost, through being known.

Or if the traditional e-book-ish deal doesn't sound very appealing, the "Advent" format can be pretty cool too.

A ton of ways to contribute: 

* Examples, showcases... anything "empirical"
* Theory, guides, explanations, ... "what it's all about"
* Short pieces where you talk about a wacky idea or vision you have; something to inspire and whet people's appetites

If you're not up for such a time investment: 

* Details: part of a website of an experience that you like, with just a single paragraph telling us what's so good about it (as part of a "design library")
* Links to must-read reference material
* Thoughts on topics we definitely need to cover (show tentative TOC)
